Feature: Check that FieldCollectionTrait works for D7

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as a user with the "administrator" role
    And article content:
      | title           | field_collection:field_fc_text_first;field_fc_text_second | field_collection_2:field_fc_text_third;field_fc_text_fourth |
      | Test collection | test_text1;test_text2                                     | test_text3;test_text4                                       |

  @api
  Scenario: Assert that collection field present on page
    When I go to "content/test-collection"
    Then I should see "test_text1"
    And I should see "test_text2"
    And I should see "test_text3"
    And I should see "test_text4"
