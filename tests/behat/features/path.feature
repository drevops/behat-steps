Feature: Check that PathTrait works
  As Behat Steps library developer
  I want to test path-related functionality
  So that I can verify proper URL paths in my application

  @api
  Scenario Outline: Assert that the path is the same as the given path
    Given I am an anonymous user
    When I go to "<src>"
    Then the path should be "<dst>"
    Examples:
      | src         | dst         |
      | /           | /           |
      | /           | <front>     |
      | <front>     | /           |
      | <front>     | <front>     |
      | /user/login | /user/login |
      | user/login  | user/login  |

  @api
  Scenario Outline: Assert that the path is not the same as the given path
    Given I am an anonymous user
    When I go to "<src>"
    Then the path should not be "<dst>"
    Examples:
      | src     | dst     |
      | /       | /user   |
      | /user   | /       |
      | user    | /       |
      | <front> | /user   |
      | /user   | <front> |
      | user    | <front> |
