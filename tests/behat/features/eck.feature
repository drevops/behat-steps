Feature: Check that EckTrait works for or D9

  Background:
    Given no test_bundle test_entity_type entities:
      | title             |
      | [TEST] ECK Entity |
    And "tags" terms:
      | name |
      | T2   |
    And test_bundle test_entity_type entities:
      | title            | field_test_text | field_test_reference |
      | [TEST] ECK test1 | Test text field | T2                   |
