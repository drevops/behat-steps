  Assertions for feature context steps (in FeatureContext.php) that are used

    When I go to "/admin/modules"
    And the response status code should be 200
    Then the "modules[book][enable]" checkbox should be unchecked

    And I go to "/admin/modules"
    And the response status code should be 200
    Then the "modules[book][enable]" checkbox should be checked

    And I go to "/admin/modules"
