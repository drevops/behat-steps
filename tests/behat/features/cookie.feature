Feature: Check that CookieTrait works
  As Behat Steps library developer
  I want to provide tools to verify browser cookies and their values
  So that users can test session management and user preferences

  Scenario: Assert step definition "a cookie with( the) name :name should exist" works as expected
    When I visit "/"
    And I set a test cookie with name "testname" and value "testvalue"
    Then a cookie with the name "testname" should exist
    And a cookie with the name "testname" should exist

  Scenario: Assert step definition "a cookie with( the) name :name should exist" works as expected with real browser

    And I set a test cookie with name "testname" and value "testvalue"
    Then a cookie with the name "testname" should exist
    And a cookie with the name "testname" should exist
