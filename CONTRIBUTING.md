Below are some guidelines for developing and maintaining the Behat steps.

## Steps format

A consistent steps format is essential for the readability and maintainability
of tests. Follow these guidelines:

- **General Guidelines**:
  - Avoid using regular expressions to define a step definition. Use tuple
    format instead for better clarity and maintainability.
  - Use descriptive placeholder names to help users quickly understand the
    expected value: `content_type` instead of `type`.
  - Use `the following` for tabled content.
  - For anything identified by a property, use `with`: <code>Then the link :
    link <b>with</b> the title :title should exist</code>
  - Avoid optional words like `(the|a)`. Provide a single form instead to ensure
    consistency.
  - Omit unnecessary suffixes like `on the page` since it is implied.
  - All method names should begin with the trait name: `userAssertHasRoles()`
    for `UserTrait`.

- **`Given`**:
  - Defines test prerequisitesâ€”conditions or data that must exist before the
    test runs.
  - Use words like `exists` or `have`.
  - Avoid using `should` or `should not` (these are reserved for assertions).
  - Refrain from using `Given I` (reserved for actions).

- **`When`**:
  - Describes an action and must contain an action verb.
  - Use the format `When I <verb>`.

- **`Then`**:
  - Specifies assertions and expectations.
  - Use `should` and `should not` to clearly indicate assertions.
  - Start the step with the entity being asserted, e.g.,
    `Then the link with a title :title exists`.
  - Avoid using `Then I`.
  - Methods should include the `Assert` prefix, e.g., `userAssertHasRoles()`.

We have some automated check for the steps format.
Run `ahoy lint-docs` to validate the format of the steps.

## Local environment setup

Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Pygmy](https://github.com/pygmystack/pygmy), [Ahoy](https://github.com/ahoy-cli/ahoy)
and shut down local web services (Apache/Nginx, MAMP etc)

- Checkout project repository in one of
  the [supported Docker directories](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/osxfs/#access-control).
- `pygmy up`
- `ahoy build`
- Access built site at http://behat-steps.docker.amazee.io/

Use `ahoy --help` to see the list of available commands.

## Running tests

There are two types of tests in this repository: unit tests and Behat tests.

### Unit tests

Unit tests are run using PHPUnit installed in the root of the repository and
are independent of the Drupal version. This allows us to use the latest
features of PHPUnit.

```bash
ahoy test-unit          # Run all unit tests

ahoy test-unit-coverage # Run tests with code coverage
```

### Behat tests

Behat tests are used as functional/integration tests to validate the
functionality of the traits. These Behat tests run in the same way they
would be run in your project: traits are included
into [FeatureContext.php](tests/behat/bootstrap/FeatureContext.php)
and then ran on the
pre-configured [fixture Drupal site](tests/behat/fixtures/d10)
using [test features](tests/behat/features).

Run `ahoy build` to setup a fixture Drupal site in the `build` directory.

```bash
ahoy test-bdd                # Run all Behat tests

ahoy test-bdd path/to/file   # Run all Behat scenarios in specific feature file

ahoy test-bdd -- --tags=wip  # Run all Behat scenarios tagged with `@wip` tag
```

### Debugging tests

- `ahoy debug`
- Set breakpoint
- Run tests with `ahoy test-bdd` - your IDE will pickup an incoming debug
  connection

## Updating fixture site

- Build the fixture site and make the required changes
- `ahoy drush cex -y`
- `ahoy update-fixtures` to copy configuration
  changes from build directory to the fixtures directory

### Validating and updating documentation

The [available steps](STEPS.md) documentation is generated automatically from
the source code.

The [steps format](#steps-format) is validated as well.

```
ahoy update-docs  # Update documentation

ahoy lint-docs    # Check documentation for errors
```
